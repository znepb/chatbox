# chatbox
This is a mod that imitates (SwitchCraft's chatbox functionality)[https://sc3.io/]. It 
consists of two parts currently: the server-side mod, and the NodeJS server. The NodeJS
server stores all the data and does all the HTTP and websocket interaction. The mod sends
messages to the NodeJS server and does commands.

# NOTICE!
This project is very dirty right now and very much in a proof-of-concept state. Things are
going to change! If you find any bugs, please create an issue. PR's are welcome, of course.
